<h1> Healthcare-readmission Prediction </h1>
A notebook that explores the relationships between diabetic records and their readmitted rates in the hospital. (Note here readmission is any re-admission 30 days post-discharge). 

My team and I believe this would create significance in the healthcare industry as readmissions are typically not covered by insurance due to many complications. By predicting readmission, we can potentially reduce financial losses for patients and hospitals by avoiding pre-mature discharges, etc.
